# Mathematic Driver for TekPower TP4000ZC
Mathematica Device Driver for the TekPower TP4000ZC Multimeter.

The TekPower TP4000ZC multimeter has RS232 support, and it sends the current data on the multimeter's screen over a Serial connection. This repository is where I am developing support for interfacing this multimeter with Mathematica using the Device Framework and the Serial driver in Mathematica.
